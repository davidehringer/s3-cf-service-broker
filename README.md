# Cloud Foundry Service Broker for Amazon S3

A Cloud Foundry Service Broker for Amazon S3 built using the [spring-boot-cf-service-broker](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/spring-boot-cf-service-broker).

The broker currently publishes a single service and plan for provisioning S3 buckets.

## Design

The broker uses meta data in S3 and naming conventions to maintain the state of the services it is brokering. It does not maintain an internal database so it has no dependencies besides S3.

## Releases

Stable versions have been tagged as [releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/s3-cf-service-broker/releases).

## Running

Simply run the JAR file and provide AWS credentials via the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` environment variables.

### Locally

```
mvn package && AWS_ACCESS_KEY=secret AWS_SECRET_KEY=secret java -jar target/s3-cf-service-broker-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### In Cloud Foundry

Build s3-cf-service-broker and push it to Cloud Foundry:

```
mvn package
cf push s3-cf-service-broker -p target/s3-cf-service-broker-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --no-start
cf set-env s3-cf-service-broker AWS_ACCESS_KEY "MYAWSKEY"
cf set-env s3-cf-service-broker AWS_SECRET_KEY "MYAWSSECRET"
cf set-env s3-cf-service-broker SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD "mysecret"
```

Start the service broker:
```
cf start s3-cf-service-broker
```

Create Cloud Foundry service broker:
```
cf create-service-broker s3-cf-service-broker user mysecret http://s3-cf-service-broker.cfapps.io
```

Add service broker to Cloud Foundry Marketplace:
```
cf enable-service-access amazon-s3 -o ORG
```

## Using the services in your application

### Format of Credentials

The credentials provided in a bind call have the following format:

```
"credentials":{
	"username":"cloud-foundry-s3-c5271ba4-6d2f-4163-843c-6a5fdceb7a1a",
	"access_key_id":"secret",
	"bucket":"cloud-foundry-2eac2d52-bfc9-4d0f-af28-c02187689d72",
	"secret_access_key":"secret"
}
```

### Java Applications - Spring Cloud

For Java applications, you may consider using [Spring Cloud](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-cloud) and the [spring-cloud-s3-service-connector](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/spring-cloud-s3-service-connector).

## Configuration

### General Configuration

The following general configuration options are available.

Environment Variable         | Required  | Default
-----------------------------|-----------|-------------
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY`             | x         |
`AWS_SECRET_KEY`             | x         |
`AWS_REGION`                 |           | `US`
`PROXY_HOST`                 |           | none
`PROXY_PORT`                 |           | none
`PROXY_USERNAME`             |           | none
`PROXY_PASSWORD`             |           | none
`PREEMPTIVE_PROXY_BASE_AUTH` |           | `false`

### Broker Security

[spring-boot-starter-security](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-starters/spring-boot-starter-security)
is used. See the documentation here for configuration: [Spring boot security](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-security)

The default password configured is "password" (see [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties)).

You may also configure security via environment variables as noted in the Spring Boot documentation.

Environment Variable         | Required  | Default
-----------------------------|-----------|-------------
`SECURITY_USER_NAME`         |           | `user`
`SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD`     |           | `password`

### User for Broker

An AWS user must be created for the broker. The user's accessKey and secretKey must be provided using the environments
variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` as noted above.

An example user policy for the broker user is provided in [broker-user-iam-policy.json](src/main/resources/broker-user-iam-policy.json). If desired, you can further limit user and group resources in this policy based on prefixes defined above.

Note: The S3 policies could be more limited based on what is actually used.

### Basic Plan

The the following attributes of the service and plan can be configured:

Environment Variable         | Default
-----------------------------|-------------
`SERVICE_ID`                 | `s3`
`SERVICE_NAME`               | `amazon-s3`
`PLAN_ID`                    | `s3-basic-plan`
`PLAN_NAME`                  | `basic`

A service provisioning call will create an S3 bucket, an IAM group, and an IAM Policy to provide access controls on the bucket. A binding call will create an IAM user, generate access keys, and add it to the bucket's group. Unbinding and deprovisioning calls will delete all resources created.

The following names are used and can be customized with a prefix:

Resource         | Name is based on     | Custom Prefix Environment Variable  | Default Prefix    | Example Name
-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------
S3 Buckets       | service instance ID  | BUCKET_NAME_PREFIX                  | cloud-foundry-    | cloud-foundry-2eac2d52-bfc9-4d0f-af28-c02187689d72
IAM Group Names  | service instance ID  | GROUP_NAME_PREFIX                   | cloud-foundry-s3- | cloud-foundry-s3-2eac2d52-bfc9-4d0f-af28-c02187689d72
IAM Policy Names | service instance ID  | POLICY_NAME_PREFIX                  | cloud-foundry-s3- | cloud-foundry-s3-2eac2d52-bfc9-4d0f-af28-c02187689d72
IAM User Names   | binding ID           | USER_NAME_PREFIX                    | cloud-foundry-s3- | cloud-foundry-s3-e9bea699-aa68-4464-bb8f-0c8622884b43

Also the following paths are used for IAM resources and can be customized with a prefix:

Resource    | Custom Path Environment Variable  | Default Path
------------|-----------------------------------|---------------
IAM User    | USER_PATH                         | /cloud-foundry/s3/
IAM Group   | GROUP_PATH                        | /cloud-foundry/s3/

#### Bucket Policy

The group policy applied to all buckets created is provided in [default-bucket-policy.json](src/main/resources/default-bucket-policy.json).

#### Bucket Tagging

All buckets are tagged with the following values:
* serviceInstanceId
* serviceDefinitionId
* planId
* organizationGuid
* spaceGuid

The ability to apply additional custom tags is in the works.

## Registering a Broker with the Cloud Controller

See [Managing Service Brokers](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html).

### Registering a private broker

If you do not have administrator credentials for your Cloud Foundry, such as public [Pivotal Web Services](https://run.pivotal.io), then you can deploy and register this broker in any Space to which you have developer access.

Build the jar file to be deployed:

```
mvn package -DskipTests
```

Configure your AWS credentials (or setup a `.envrc` if you use `direnv allow`):

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXX
export AWS_SECRET_KEY=YYYYY
export SECURITY_USER_NAME=myuser
export SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD=mypassword
export APPNAME=s3-broker
```

Copy and paste the following:

```
ORG=$(cf t | grep Org: | awk '{print $2}')
SPACE=$(cf t | grep Space: | awk '{print $2}')
cat >my-manifest.yml <<EOS
---
applications:
  - name: $APPNAME
    buildpack: java_buildpack
    path: $(ls target/*.jar)
    host: $APPNAME-$ORG-$SPACE
    memory: 512M
    env:
      SERVICE_ID: $(uuid)
      PLAN_ID: $(uuid)
      SERVICE_NAME: $APPNAME-$ORG-$SPACE
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY
      AWS_SECRET_KEY: $AWS_SECRET_KEY
      SECURITY_USER_NAME: $SECURITY_USER_NAME
      SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD: $SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD
EOS

cf push -f my-manifest.yml
```

Now the broker can be confirmed to be running:

```
BROKER_URL=$(cf app $APPNAME  | grep urls: | awk '{print $2}')
curl https://$SECURITY_USER_NAME:$SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD@$BROKER_URL/v2/catalog
```

Now, register the broker as a private space-only broker:

```
brew install jq
SPACE_GUID=$(cat ~/.cf/config.json | jq -r .SpaceFields.Guid)
cf curl -X POST /v2/service_brokers -d "{  
  \"broker_url\": \"https://${BROKER_URL}\",
  \"space_guid\": \"${SPACE_GUID}\",
  \"name\": \"$APPNAME-$ORG-$SPACE\",
  \"auth_username\": \"$SECURITY_USER_NAME\",
  \"auth_password\": \"$SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD\"
}"
```

Confirm that the broker is registered:

```
cf service-brokers
cf marketplace
```

Anyone with developer access to this Space can create/bind/unbind/deprovision AWS S3 buckets now:

```
cf create-service $APPNAME-$ORG-$SPACE basic my-bucket
```

## Testing

Export AWS credentials environment variables:
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"
export AWS_SECRET_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"
```

and execute tests with maven:
```
mvn test
```
